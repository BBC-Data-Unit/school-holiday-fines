In March 2018 **Laurence Cawley** [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43254495) that parents across England and Wales had been fined about £24m for failing to send their children to school during the past three years. The data unit helped create a map (with Daniel Dunford from the Visual Journalism team) and charts to illustrate the story.
